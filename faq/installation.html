    <h2>Downloading</h2>
    <p>When you download SusClient, you can choose one of two options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Release:</strong> this version is updated less frequently, but is preferred if you don’t want to update often.
        <ul>
          <li>You can download it on the official website;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Dev build:</strong> this version is updated frequently, can have some bugs, but often has less than the release.
        <ul>
          <li>You can get this version from the official website, the #dev-builds channel in the SusClient Discord, or by compiling the source from GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If your antivirus flags SusClient as dangerous, it is probably because it is an executable (JAR) file.
      If you have any concerns feel free to check the source code located within this repository.</p>

    <h2>Installing</h2>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>To play Minecraft, you’ll need to have the compatible version of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
      Usually Minecraft downloads it automatically, but if it doesn’t, you should get it from Adoptium.
      The current version used by Minecraft is v17.</p>
    <h3>Unsafe cracked launchers</h3>
    <p>Avoid using closed source third-party launchers (TLauncher is a common example).
      Since nobody can look at the code, the developers could insert malicious code, that could potentially harm your devices.
      We do not provide support to cracked users in any way, as they do not legally own the game.</p>
    <h3>Minecraft Launcher</h3>
    <p>If you already have Fabric Loader installed, skip to step 4.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Fabric installer and run it.</li>
      <li>Make sure the correct Minecraft version is selected, the path to your .minecraft folder is correct, and create profile is checked.</li>
      <li>Click Install and then wait for the process to complete.</li>
      <li>Open your .minecraft folder and create a folder within it called mods if it does not exist already.</li>
      <li>Go to where you downloaded SusClient and drag the JAR file into the mods folder.
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the file appears to be a zip because of WinRAR, or the icon is missing, ignore that as it is still a JAR</p>
      </li>
      <li>Open the Minecraft Launcher and select the Fabric profile.</li>
      <li>That’s it, just click Launch to start up SusClient.</li>
    </ol>
